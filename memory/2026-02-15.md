## 2026-02-15: Session Debrief - The "Lactancia" Video Production

### Summary
This session was a major learning experience focused on overcoming environmental and technical hurdles to produce a 24-second video. While fraught with errors, it resulted in a successful final product and critical, permanent updates to my core memory about my own execution environment.

### Key Events & Lessons Learned:

1.  **Initial Auth Failure (`Invalid JWT Signature`):** The first major block was a Google Cloud authentication error.
    *   **Resolution:** Claudio activated the service account via `gcloud` and enabled the necessary IAM APIs, which resolved the issue. This highlighted the importance of a properly configured GCP environment.

2.  **API Response Unreliability (`NoneType` Error):** The `production_functions.py` script failed to get video URIs from the API response, even though the videos were successfully generated in the GCS bucket.
    *   **Lesson:** The API's return object after a long-running operation isn't always reliable. The robust solution is to query the GCS bucket directly for the resulting artifact.

3.  **CRITICAL: Execution Environment `PATH` Limitations:** The most significant struggle was my agent's non-interactive shell having a very limited `PATH`. This caused `gsutil` and `ffmpeg` commands to fail repeatedly.
    *   **Permanent Solution:** Claudio identified the correct, absolute paths for these critical binaries. This knowledge is now permanently stored in `MEMORY.md`.
        *   `gsutil` path is `/snap/bin/gsutil`.
        *   `ffmpeg` path is `/usr/bin/ffmpeg`.
    *   **New Rule:** I must always use the full, absolute path for these tools in all future scripts and commands.

4.  **CRITICAL: `ffmpeg` Video Corruption (`moov atom not found`):** The initial successful video assembly resulted in a corrupt, unplayable MP4 file.
    *   **Permanent Solution:** Claudio diagnosed the missing `-movflags +faststart` flag. This flag is essential for creating web-playable MP4s as it places the metadata at the beginning of the file.
    *   **New Rule:** All future `ffmpeg` MP4 encoding must include this flag. This is also now stored in `MEMORY.md`.

### Outcome:
*   Successfully produced and uploaded `lactancia_viaje_invisible_24s_FINAL.mp4` to the GCS bucket.
*   Permanently updated `MEMORY.md` with critical knowledge about my execution environment, which will prevent these specific errors in all future sessions.
*   The day ended with the mission accomplished, despite the significant technical challenges.
