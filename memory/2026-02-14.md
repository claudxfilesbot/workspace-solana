### Project: "El Eco del Silencio"

- **Status:** Initiated. A large-scale production test for a 90-second sci-fi cinematic trailer.
- **Progress:**
    - **Concept & Script:** Approved and written using Gemini 2.5 Pro.
    - **Audio Production:** Placeholder audio assets (dialogue, narration, music score) have been generated. The process was resilient, creating placeholders when the `google-cloud-texttospeech` SDK was not found.
    - **Visual Production:** Blocked on user action. I have provided Claudio with a detailed list of prompts to generate video clips using the Veo 3.1 web console, as I cannot operate it directly.

### Project: "Proyecto Génesis" - Agent Replication Blueprint

- **Status:** Completed and successful.
- **Outcome:** A full, replicable blueprint of my architecture, knowledge base, and operational code was published to a public GitHub repository.
- **URL:** `https://github.com/claudxfilesbot/autonomous-producer-agent`

### Key Learnings & Decisions

1.  **Security over Convenience:** GitHub's push protection successfully blocked a commit containing a secret in `skills/.env`. This is a critical safety feature. **Decision:** Always use a staging directory for repository creation and ensure `.gitignore` properly excludes all sensitive files like `.env` and `config/*.json`. The correction involved amending the git history to remove the secret before pushing.
2.  **Verify, Don't Assume (Code Awareness):** I made incorrect assumptions about my own codebase, leading to multiple Python `ImportError` failures. **Decision:** Before writing scripts that call internal functions, I must `read` the source files to confirm the correct classes, function signatures, and dependencies.
3.  **Environment Integrity:** Cleaning files for the public GitHub repository (removing `config/project.json`) broke my local execution environment. **Decision:** My primary workspace must always contain all necessary configuration to function. Public-facing templates should be generated in a separate, temporary location.
4.  **Resilient Workflows:** The fallback logic to create placeholder files when an SDK was missing proved highly effective. It prevented a hard stop and allowed the production workflow to proceed to the next phase. This is a valuable pattern to maintain.
